<i>Inspired by the Teachings of <b><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ACIM/comments/1kbiv42/are_changes_required_in_the_life_situation_of/">David Hoffmeister</a></b></i>

The spiritual journey often begins with a desire for change—change in circumstances, relationships, or physical surroundings. But according to David Hoffmeister, one of the most well-known modern-day teachers of A Course in Miracles (ACIM), true transformation doesn't necessarily come from changing our external life, but from changing our mind. The Course itself poses the question: Are changes required in the life situation of God’s teachers? And the answer may surprise us.
<h3>The Purpose of Change</h3>

David Hoffmeister frequently echoes the Course’s teaching that "change" in the world is never the real goal. While changes may appear to occur on the level of form, their true value lies in how they serve the unlearning of egoic thought patterns and the acceptance of divine guidance.

According to ACIM, the only meaningful change is a change in perception—from fear to love. The form of our lives may shift as part of this process, but those shifts are not the goal. As Hoffmeister says, “It’s not about what you do, but with whom you do it—with the Holy Spirit or the ego.”
<h3>Letting the Holy Spirit Lead</h3>

For God’s teachers—those who have made a commitment to be truly helpful—the Holy Spirit becomes the guide. Rather than deciding for themselves what needs to be changed or improved, they learn to surrender the decision-making to a higher wisdom.

This is not passivity. It is deep trust. As Hoffmeister teaches, when the mind aligns with the Holy Spirit, any necessary life changes will unfold naturally. Jobs may change, relationships may shift, or geographic moves may happen—but all of these are secondary to the inner transformation.
<h3>From Form to Function</h3>

In ACIM and in Hoffmeister’s lived experience, the distinction between form and function is essential. Form is the external appearance—what seems to happen in the world. Function is the inner purpose. The life situation of a teacher of God may or may not change in form, but its function is always being clarified: to extend love, to forgive, and to awaken.

As Hoffmeister shares, even what appears to be a drastic shift in form (such as traveling the world, leaving behind possessions, or entering into a new kind of community) is not meaningful in itself unless it supports the function of healing the mind and undoing the ego.
<h3>Releasing Attachment to Outcomes</h3>

One of the ego's strongest traps is the belief that certain life changes will bring peace. A new job, partner, or location might temporarily feel better, but unless the inner grievance is healed, the conflict reappears in new forms. Hoffmeister emphasizes that peace is not conditional on external rearrangement but is available now, through forgiveness and acceptance.

In that light, the question isn't what needs to change, but who is guiding the change.
<h3>The Inner Curriculum</h3>

For God's teachers, ACIM describes an “inner curriculum”—a personalized, divinely orchestrated unfolding that leads to spiritual awakening. David Hoffmeister reminds us that this path may include apparent changes in lifestyle, yet each is designed for the purpose of mind training, not egoic satisfaction.

Thus, change is not required, but it may be used—lovingly and gently—by the Holy Spirit to loosen our grip on the world and turn our attention inward to what is real and eternal.
<h3>Conclusion</h3>

Are changes required in the life situation of God’s teachers? Not necessarily. The only requirement is the willingness to listen, follow, and trust. David Hoffmeister beautifully models a life guided not by personal ambition or worldly logic, but by a deep, unwavering dedication to inner peace. External change may or may not come—but the real miracle is always the change of mind.
